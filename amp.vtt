1
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.340
Thank you so much for coming and watching over talk today.

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.560
My name is Hahn.

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.500
I am an interaction designer working on and stories and I'm the name of her Gallagher, a product manager working on our stories.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.560
We are both incredibly excited and grateful for the opportunity to share with you all what we've been working on.

5
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:34.330
Mobile phones have emerged as one of the primary devices on which we consume content, and stories have emerged as one of the most delightful content types to consume on our phones.

6
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.270
Certain demographics of users consume primarily stories invented by Snapchat.

7
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.180
Stories have found their way onto Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp just to name a few apps.

8
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.030
Stories feel truly native to your phone.

9
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.820
Users love them and they are beautiful.

10
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.070
You don't have to rotate your phone.

11
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.830
You don't have to scroll through long pages of text.

12
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.740
The interaction model of tapping to navigate is simple and delightful.

13
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.850
However, stories do not exist at scale.

14
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.350
On the open web, they are not easily findable, shareable or likeable.

15
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.010
And this is where app stories come in.

16
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.470
We believe there is distinct value in having stories live on the open web.

17
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.230
First, you are in control.

18
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.820
You own the content.

19
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.450
You completely control monetization.

20
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.340
Second, stories have features and stories have features that are unique to the web.

21
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.740
They can link to other parts of your site.

22
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.780
They can be discovered by search engines and they can be embedded in any Web page.

23
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.830
Finally, and stories are both fast and immersive.

24
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.290
And stories are important because they enable you to offer the delightful story experience on the Web.

25
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.040
In February 2018, we first introduced AMP stories.

26
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.430
Since then, we have seen publishers produce beautiful content about a wide array of topics.

27
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.590
Today, we will talk about the benefits of building and stories on the open web.

28
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.010
First, we will talk about where stories appear on both Google search and discover.

29
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.560
We want you as a publisher of AMP Stories to be able to reach a wide audience.

30
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.680
And we want to improve the user journeys on both Google search and discover by displaying app stories.

31
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.150
Second, we will go over the many new capabilities that we've added to app stories to help you build beautiful content.

32
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.050
Third, we will cover best practices for creating high quality app stories for it.

33
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.900
We will describe ways that publishers can generate revenue and advertisers can build and promote their brands by creating stories.

34
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.010
Finally, we'll describe a few different creation tools that enable you to build up stories without having to write your own team out.

35
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.900
Now handed over to Hong Kong to talk about where stories appear on both Google search and discover.

36
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.680
Thanks many.

37
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.650
So now let's all get excited and start with and stories on Google services.

38
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.430
So off you have created all this beautiful and stories.

39
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.690
The main question you might have is how can users easily discover them?

40
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:31.310
Well, as Rene mentioned before, the great things about app in general is that your stories are just regular web pages so they can be accessible wherever sue publisher sites.

41
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.420
So social platforms and of course, so search engines like Google.

42
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:48.410
So am stories can show up on Google search today in web results and top stories in order to make the whole search experience more visual and interactive.

43
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.730
We're working on a dedicated placement for and stories saw search for queries in specific categories.

44
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.790
So now let's use travel as example and all get on a visual search journey together.

45
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.080
I think May is a great season to travel to Japan.

46
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.900
So why don't we imagine ourselves searching for things to do in Tokyo?

47
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.270
And here you have the centuries old page.

48
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:30.390
You start screwing and exploring the cool content and you find this beautiful blog serving your cool travel visual stories, tapping on any of this cover would take you right into the story.

49
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.270
So now you're able to enjoy your reading experience by simply taps through the pages.

50
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.560
And if you want to grow something else, you can just simply swipe to the next story.

51
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.770
You will get this endless discovery experience by continuously swiping to the next.

52
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.960
How amazing is this?

53
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.000
I can't wait to see this rolling out in the next couple months.

54
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.300
I see solved.

55
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.180
You guys already try to get this on your phone right now.

56
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.400
Well, please stay tuned.

57
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.320
Is coming very soon.

58
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.370
And the things to do in Tokyo, example we just saw is really just a teaser.

59
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:19.150
The so many cool places to withered around the word and by adding this new experience to Google search, users will start getting more and more engaging travel stories.

60
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:36.880
We will start with travel because we believe that looking at a rich content experience like this can really helping user get a better understanding of the travel destinations and the users can engage more before they even physically get to the destinations.

61
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.040
And this travel Michelle stories also tend to be evergreen, so they are still relevant months after being published.

62
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.520
And of course, story format works really well with other content categories.

63
00:05:52.330 --> 00:06:02.210
After trouble, we will experiment with gaming, fashion recipe movies, TV shows and even more content categories.

64
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.180
So be on the regular search experience.

65
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:16.180
Google also offers you a browse forward experience in the Discover fee for all time users that do not need to have a career in mind.

66
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.390
A quick reminder on what's Discover.

67
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:30.250
So Discover is a feature within Google search that helps user to stay up to date with your all time favorite topics without needing a query.

68
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.400
Users get to their discover experience.

69
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:53.110
Sue the Google app found the Google Scholar Mobile Home page or by simply swipe right from their home screen on pixel fonts, discover Haskell and significantly and now helps more than 800 million monthly active users to get inspired and explore great content.

70
00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:02.770
The exciting news is that in the past six months, we have also been featuring great arms stories in the Discover feat.

71
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:12.090
We served many high quality stories based on a diverse range of topics and we saw great user engagement.

72
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.960
We believe that stories face really well with the use of my site in Discover.

73
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.850
So we're playing on focus even more on this platform moving forward.

74
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:30.110
So now I'll hand it back to Vinay to walk you through the exciting AMP story format updates.

75
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.210
Thanks, hon.

76
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.490
Let's go over the new capabilities that we've added to help you build beautiful stories that users love.

77
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.920
The first is localization.

78
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.170
When aren't stories first launched, it only supported English, which was actually very limiting.

79
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.350
Today, it supports 21 different locales.

80
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:59.080
To use these new languages, set the lang attribute to the corresponding language and local code on the H2 email tag of your app story.

81
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:06.470
If your story should be displayed in right to left format, you should add the DIR equals RTL attribute as well.

82
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.670
Let's move on to desktop.

83
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:18.230
The default experience on desktop reuses the mobile design so that publishers can simply create for mobile and have a design that works everywhere.

84
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:28.430
However, one of the major benefits of app stories is that they live on the web and they reach a wide audience of users, many of whom are on desktop and laptop computers.

85
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:36.950
We realize that we can build an amazing desktop experience by using full screen images and video on a desktop computer.

86
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.700
This feels a lot more natural and it brings the same feeling of immersion that we see with app stories on mobile phones.

87
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.220
It does require you as the publisher to do a little bit more work in terms of getting the right art direction.

88
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.850
However, if you have a sizeable desktop audience, the uplifting user experience is worth the effort.

89
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:03.300
This experience was designed and developed in a collaboration with The Washington Post, whose story you see here.

90
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.490
They worked closely with us to experiment with this experience and prove its effectiveness.

91
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:16.390
Once we understood the value that this brought to users reproduction, I used it and shipped it as a core part of the app stories at.

92
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.340
The Washington Post has continued to publish a number of amazing stories using the desktop experience.

93
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.350
Since launching this experience publicly, we have also seen great contact by the S.F.

94
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.610
Chronicle. So how do you get this experience on your stories?

95
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.110
The short answer is to just add the sports landscape attribute to the story tag.

96
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.660
However, you will notice that some images and videos are not appropriately cropped.

97
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:55.120
This is because by default on all screen sizes, we do a sensor crop where only the sensor most portion of the image is shown.

98
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.680
To correct this, use the new object position attribute.

99
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:08.930
On AMP image and AMP video, the object position attribute takes an X percentage and a Y percentage as the focal point.

100
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:20.360
In this example, we set the focal point to seventy five percent on the x axis and 40 percent on the Y axis, which is roughly the most important part of this photo.

101
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.840
The browser will then shift the photo over and attempt to make the focal point as close as possible to the center of the screen.

102
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.440
Giving us a much better crop.

103
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.830
You'll notice, however, that on landscape, the photo remains unchanged.

104
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:47.180
That's because in this case, the focal point cannot actually be moved any closer to the center of the screen while the full why look while the photo still covers the entire screen.

105
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:59.840
Let's move on to talk about the sidebar publishers told us that they wanted a navigational affords to allow users to navigate to different parts of their site from their app stories.

106
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.870
So we've added support for AMP sidebar.

107
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.660
This adds a sidebar or hamburger menu to the top right of your AMP story pages.

108
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.030
Using AMP sidebar is relatively straightforward.

109
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:24.250
You can embed the AMP side bar tag as a direct child of AMP story, all of the content within the sidebar tag will appear in the sidebar menu.

110
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.770
Next up is attachments.

111
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.650
Stories are great because they're concise.

112
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.710
However, there are times when you want to enable your audience to dive deeper into a particular topic.

113
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.740
And this is where attachments come in.

114
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.140
To open an attachment, a user can simply swipe up from the bottom of a page.

115
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.430
As a publisher, you control the content of the attachment entirely.

116
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:57.020
To add an attachment to your page, add the AMP story page, attach tag as a direct child of AMP story page.

117
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:05.270
This will add a UI it to the bottom of the page that a user can usually swipe up on to reveal the scroll will paint.

118
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:19.620
All of the H team L for an attachment must be within the AMS story page attachment tags, attachment attachments can contain many AMP components that are not supported on AMP story pages.

119
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.230
The last component we'll talk about is embeds.

120
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.050
One of the great things about the web is the ability to embed content within your page.

121
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.630
We are adding the ability to embed different types of content in your AMP story pages.

122
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:43.010
One challenge with adding interactive embeds to stories is that users have to navigate in this particular example.

123
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:48.620
If a user is tapping quickly through this story, we don't want the user to accidentally start playing this video.

124
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.500
This is why tapping an interactive embed triggers a tooltip with navigation arrows.

125
00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.370
Tapping the navigation arrows navigates while tapping the tooltip brings the Twitter embed into full focus.

126
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:07.400
This allows the user to interact with the content fully without breaking the navigational flow.

127
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:17.720
Each of the embeds that we support is an app component, so embedding them in your story is as simple as just using that app component.

128
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:26.180
In this example here we are embedding a tweet so we can utilize the app Twitter component just like it in a regular app page.

129
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:32.210
We're going to be rolling each of these components out individually over the next few months.

130
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.290
Now headed back to Hong who we'll talk about best practices.

131
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.550
Thanks, man.

132
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.200
I can't wait to see upcoming stories creating with all this cool features.

133
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.620
So be on offer you great features and flexibilities to create stories.

134
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.460
We also want it either for you to produce high quality stories.

135
00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:02.980
We updated our story best practice on amped our death to make it easier for you to understand what makes a good story.

136
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.720
We all know that story is a new and a unique content format.

137
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:18.340
So if you're looking for inspirations ideas to start creating delightful stories, you can go check out our best practice to ensure your story quality.

138
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.940
So now let's take a look of some detail examples.

139
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.740
So when you make a story, always make sure your story is complete and self-contained.

140
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.680
Keep your readers engaged with in the story.

141
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.650
Don't require them to click on links to go to other Web site to get essential information.

142
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.220
Use tax, know clear and concise way.

143
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.170
Keep your audience engaged by avoiding putting large block of tax on the page.

144
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.490
Keep in mind that story is so visually driven format.

145
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.890
So police use rich media to tell your story and add text to enhance it.

146
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:10.630
Sometimes you think different font size or font style can help you break up the block of tax and then make the whole scam ability more easy.

147
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:18.910
Always make sure your tax is legible using high contrast to make every single word on your page.

148
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:19.960
Easy to see.

149
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:28.370
Take advantage of the beautiful four screen, tried to use forfeited assets as much as possible.

150
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:37.070
You can create a more compelling and immersive page experience by using the full bleed portray to base images and videos.

151
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:48.380
Another good thing about using the portrayed assets is it can help cut off the non important information on the page and help your readers to focus on one key single subject.

152
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.290
And we all know that motion plays an important role in the storytelling.

153
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.590
So be creative with the animation usage.

154
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.870
You can bring static imagery to life by the proper usage of animations.

155
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:10.080
Please keep in mind that animation should always enhance the visual, but not destructive visual.

156
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:20.190
In the last example here, animating individual objects separately to the page make the whole visual experience looks more interesting and enjoyable.

157
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.640
On the right.

158
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.120
Some will hear the effects on the background.

159
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.130
Image looks nice and subtle.

160
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:33.720
It also helps create a nice balance with the tax holiday together and make the whole page experience feels more immersive.

161
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:39.150
I hope this examples are helpful to look at more accessible like this.

162
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.400
Please check out our 4 AM story best practice on Amador.

163
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.010
Moving forward, let's talk about modernization.

164
00:16:49.010 --> 00:17:03.260
So if stories offer you this fast and immersive mobile first content experience, we also think that stories can create a great opportunity to make advertising's more beautiful and immersive.

165
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:09.870
In the past one year, we have also been working really hard on the app stores modernization site.

166
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:16.080
So now we can provide you a diverse of ways to monetize your stories.

167
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.640
And today we're going to talk about three of them.

168
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.230
First up, a story out.

169
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:31.330
So if you are a publisher that makes revenue on Web articles, you have now created a beautiful and story.

170
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.110
So what is your best option to monetize your content?

171
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:42.760
To better answer this question, we actually looked back and the borrow principles for how advertising worked.

172
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.690
A magazine's.

173
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:52.030
So when you look at the beautiful magazine, the acting side always feel really immersive and take up the entire page.

174
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.010
The ads are placed tastefully in the right sections, never feel overloaded.

175
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.300
And finally, they're very flexible.

176
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:08.420
It opens up this cleaning and a blank canvas to allow advertisers to create whatever ad they want.

177
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:20.340
So as story ads, we wanted to ensure that the ads always feel immersive and take up entire real estate available off the device.

178
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.530
We'll also make sure that the ads is only going to load once 40 loaded.

179
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.350
So no more loading indicators.

180
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:35.830
Here's one example where the BMW created a beautiful story out showcasing autonomous driving.

181
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:47.270
The placement of the ad is orchestrated by the AMP stories will optimize where the ad goes for the right user at the right time.

182
00:18:48.180 --> 00:19:01.710
This allows us to create a great balance between the ACT density and publisher revenue and the one the ad is 40 loaded and ready to show, we'll simply splice the ad into the poppy show story.

183
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:20.060
Story adds also helps open up a flexible canvas to although advertisers to show whatever media they want from tax to images to videos or even animations, they're all built on the top of the AMP H2 model ad framework.

184
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.730
So the capabilities here are analysts.

185
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.460
And the stories are already life today for publishers who are using Google go at managers.

186
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:45.030
If you are an advertiser in this particular case into it, you can basically go talk to any publisher that's creating or serving stories and using Google ad manager to deliver your ads into the story.

187
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.480
So here's an example of a Washington Post story.

188
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.600
And the wonder at ad is ready to show.

189
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.340
The Intuit ad was simply show up.

190
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.090
And later in the summer, we will launch programmatic support.

191
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:08.280
So now as a advertiser, you were able to directly using the Race 360 to target any publisher onboard.

192
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.440
And you think will go ad manager to deliver your ads into the stories.

193
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.240
To make it a super easy for you to get started.

194
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:27.340
We have created beautiful story as templates and made them available for you to download for free on amped our death.

195
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.380
And of course, the entire canvas is free and flexible.

196
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.640
We just want to get you quickly started with a few common format.

197
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.810
And this Templars are all available on Amsterdam today.

198
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.030
So you can download them and then design add in the ways you prefer.

199
00:20:49.520 --> 00:21:02.180
So now let's talk about the failing links, so any links are links which, although a publisher to modernize their outgoing links, one, the user purchased some something on the length advertise this landing page.

200
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.620
In a way, stories already support of failing links today.

201
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.830
You can add any outgoing links with a story page.

202
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:19.390
So in this example here, if you tap all get now, you're able to continue to go to the product landing page.

203
00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:27.240
But we want to make the whole user experience more consistent across users for all publishers.

204
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:39.050
So we're working on a special UI to let a finish links to uniformly pass the system level to indicate this is and Finland link and I want to use tax on them.

205
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.110
The publishers can control what you show.

206
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:48.350
It could be things like the price of the product or the domain is going to in the photo op state.

207
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.870
In this example here, it's really clear for the user to know where they're going to and the price of the product.

208
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.920
Finally, let's switch gears and talk about lots of stories.

209
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:11.870
So what we mean by small scale stories are really just the stories that created by order of Tyson's for marketing purposes.

210
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:19.220
For example, here's a sponsor's story that created by L'Oreal for promoting their new product.

211
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.480
The rush per say.

212
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:32.400
This works great for L'Oreal because users could get a quick idea off the product being this fast and immersive mobile force content experience within just a few taps.

213
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:39.270
So instead of creating a whole new web landing page, L'Oreal has chosen to create a story.

214
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:53.010
L'Oreal also uses QR code to create an all flying to online strategy where they send users to their stories by simply scan the QR code on the back of their package box.

215
00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:05.550
They also enable the really cool NFC technology in their physical products station where they send users to the story by one simple scan, as you can see in the right video here.

216
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.880
Notice how quickly the story loads.

217
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.230
There is no need to download any additional apps on apps.

218
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.850
In order to get the story.

219
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:22.050
This although to deliver amazing content right away to you from one simple URL.

220
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:34.050
And we also know that large publishers already have a big sponsor content business where they read editorial content on behalf of the advertisers.

221
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:47.310
So here's an example where the paragraph created a beautiful travel sponsored story talking about Garnsey and because this is an app story, so it works beautifully on desktop as well.

222
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.530
The questioning advertising is now.

223
00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.790
You have created all this beautiful experience.

224
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.190
How can you drive traffic to spots a story and how can you get users to find them?

225
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.950
Well, here we have a few examples.

226
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:12.850
The first one is when you use fossil stories as many pages in Google as the sponsor's story will be automatically deliver from AMP cash.

227
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.620
Therefore, from a user standpoint, the experience will be really snappy, fast and immersive.

228
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:28.860
And sponsored stories can also be embedded inside off your regular Web pages, just like any of the other AM stories.

229
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:36.240
Because once the story is reaches the landing page so you can embedded in sand, I frame and put it on your page.

230
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.320
And the one useful tap on it, it will launch into this beautiful for screen experience.

231
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:49.890
You can find out all the sinful, full and the more about and stories monetization, I'll amped all dab slash stories.

232
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.410
